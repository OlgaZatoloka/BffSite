                        festival. BFF’s mission is to provide a public forum in Brooklyn in order to advance public
                        interest in films and the independent production of films. To draw worldwide attention to
                        Brooklyn as a center for cinema. To encourage the rights of all Brooklyn residents to access
                        and experience the power of independent filmmaking, and to promote artistic excellence and the
                        creative freedom of artists without censure. BFF, inc. is a not-for-profit organization. </p>


                    <p class="pabout text-left">

                        The festival is for and by independent filmmakers. The organizers of BFF bring 21 years of
                        festival experience to this annual event. BFF accepts submissions in six categories: Narrative
                        Features, Documentary Features, Short Narrative, Short Documentary, Experimental, and
                        Animation. Submissions are open from July to March of the following year, the final selection
                        of 150+ films is announced in May, and the film festival takes place in June. Selected films in
                        each category are eligible for several awards. In addition to our lineup of films, the festival
                        also hosts multiple filmmaker parties and networking events at venues around Brooklyn and New
                        York City. </p>

                        Many of the award-winning films from the Brooklyn Film Festival have gone on to have theatrical
                        releases, to have nationwide broadcasts on PBS and HBO, and to be nominated and awarded at both
                        the British and the American Academy Awards. </p>

                    <p class="text">Besieged (Italian title: L'assedio) is a 1998 film by Bernardo Bertolucci starring
                        Thandie Newton and David Thewlis. The film is based on the short story "The Siege" by James
                        Lasdun.The film opens in an unnamed African town where Shandurai (Thandie Newton) watches with
                        distress as a school teacher is taken away by police.

                        In Rome, Shandurai is now a housemaid for Jason Kinsky (David Thewlis), an eccentric English
                        pianist and composer, and is also a promising medical student. Kinsky is in love with
                        Shandurai, sending gifts down to her room via the dumbwaiter. One gift is a ring, which leads
                        to an impassioned marriage proposal, which she rejects. Asked how he could make her love him,
                        she shouts, “Get my husband out of jail!” Only then does Kinsky realize that Shandurai is
                        married.

                        Shandurai notices a tapestry and some figurines she had dusted are now missing. Later, Kinsky
                        begins composing using Shandurai, vacuuming nearby, as his muse. Hearing his piano riffs, she
                        begins to fall in love herself.

                        surreal elements of the Western genre. William Blake (Johnny Depp), an accountant from
                        Cleveland, Ohio, rides by train to the frontier company town of Machine to assume a promised
                        job as an accountant in the town's metal works. Jobless and without money or prospects, Blake
                        meets Thel Russell (Mili Avital), a former prostitute who sells paper flowers.Thel's
                        ex-boyfriend Charlie surprises them in bed and shoots at Blake, accidentally killing Thel when
                        she tries to shield Blake with her body. A wounded Blake shoots and kills Charlie with Thel's
                        gun before climbing dazedly out the window and fleeing Machine on a stolen horse. Company-owner
                        Dickinson he hires three legendary frontier killers, Cole Wilson, Conway Twill, and Johnny "The
                        Kid" Pickett to bring Blake back 'dead or alive'. </p>

                    <p class="text">Fantastic Mr. Fox is a 2009 American stop-motion animated comedy film based on
                        Roald Dahl's children's novel of the same name. The film is about a fox who steals food each
                        night from three mean and wealthy farmers. They are fed up with Mr. Fox's theft and try to kill
                        him, so they dig their way into the foxes' home, but the animals are able to outwit the farmers
                        and live underground.While raiding Berk's Squab Farm, Mr. Fox and his wife Felicity trigger a
                        fox trap and become caged. Felicity reveals to Fox that she is pregnant and pleads with him to
                        find a safer job if they escape. Fox reluctantly agrees.

                        Two years later, the Foxes and their sullen son Ash are living in a hole. Fox, now a newspaper
                        columnist, moves the family into a better home in the base of a tree, ignoring the warnings of
                        his lawyer Badger about how dangerous the area is for foxes. The tree is located very close to
                        facilities run by three farmers: Walter Boggis, Nathan Bunce, and Franklin Bean.
